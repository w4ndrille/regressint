    <p>
      <em>pyspread</em> is a non-traditional spreadsheet application that is based on and written in the programming language Python. The goal of <em>pyspread</em> is to be the most pythonic spreadsheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>pyspread</em> expects Python expressions in its grid cells, which makes a spreadsheet specific language obsolete. Each cell returns a Python object that can be accessed from other cells. These objects can represent anything including lists or matrices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>pyspread</em> is free software. It is released under the GPL v3 licence.
