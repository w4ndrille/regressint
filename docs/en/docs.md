Following *pyspread*, *tablo* provides a three dimensional grid. Rows, columns and tables are treated similar, so that each row, column and table is identified by a number. Therefore, pyspread allows editing three dimensional arrays. These arrays can later addressed as numpy arrays for further computation.

Cell functions in pyspread that are known from conventional spreadsheets such as Excel, gnumeric or LibreOffice.org Calc are not supported, yet.
